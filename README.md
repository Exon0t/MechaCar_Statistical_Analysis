# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  * Ground_clearance and Vehicle_length are variables that provid a non random ammount of variance
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  * The slove the the linear model is considered to be zero cause the p-value is under .0 siting at 5.35e-11 
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  * This linear model mpg does effectivly show the data because the median is just at 0 with simular min and max meaning the graph is quiete leveled .
  
  
  ## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
  
  * The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
    * The design specifications for the MechaCar suspensions does not exceed 100 psi all together. How ever in each individual lot it does surprase the ammount in lot 3 with a woping 70 psi over the specifications. 
    
  ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
 * then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
  * first we can see that the p value is ver small meaning that the chance that its not going to equal to 0 are very low. meaning the numbers are really tight together. you can also see this while looking at the 95 percentil cofidence interfal.
